## Summary

This summary pertains to an Instagram clone built from scratch using React, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. The application includes various pages such as login, sign up, dashboard, and user profile pages. These pages are either public or private with auth listeners. Firebase firestore is utilized to manage all the data, which is accessed through a custom hook. 

Tailwind CSS was used in this project and was found to be a more user-friendly option compared to styled components. The author has decided that this will be their final project using Firebase, as it is too complicated to use and test with tools like Cypress and Jest due to a lack of a great mocking library.
